# Py OLC 3DGame Engine

Port of the Olc 3D Game engine by [Javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) to a Python version, to learn more about 3d rendering.
This version lacks the fetures of part 4 atm since I haven't gotten around to doing it.

I know it is not that clean but I am cleaning up a bit atm.
